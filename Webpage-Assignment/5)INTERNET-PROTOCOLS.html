                IP stands for Internet Protocol and IP is an acronym, for Internet Protocol. Protocol is a set of rules.
                The
                protocol for routing and addressing packets of data is the Internet Protocol, so data can get to the
                right
                location, after traveling across networks. Packets is the division of data traversing the Internet in
                smaller
                pieces. Router help send the correct data to their allocated places, using the IP information that have
                been
                divided to smaller pieces called packets. All internet connecting capable devices and domains are
                allocated an
                IP address, and data then arrives where it needs to be, because the packets are directed to the IP
                addresses
                attached to them. The most popular transport protocols are the TCP and UDP transport protocols, and the
                packets
                therefore are handled, according to the transport protocol in combination with IP, that the packets
                arrived at.
            </p>
            <p>
                An IP address an identifier that is only unique, to the device or domain, that is about to connect to
                the
                internet. The DNS is there to convert the IP addresses (e.g. 192.168.1.1), to readable text that humans
                can
                read, then memorizing a complex series of numbers, in the IP address, same thing vice versa. The IP
                packet will
                have both the IP addresses, of the recipient and the sender’s domains or devices.

                TRANMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL
            </h2>
            <p>
                The acronym for Transmission Control Protocol is TCP, and TCP is an Internet Protocol. Transmission
                Control
                Protocol offers end-to-end packet delivery. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a standard that
                defines how
                to establish and maintain a network conversation through which application programs can exchange data.
                (Ben
                Lutevich, 12) Transmission Control Protocol defines how computers send packets of data to each, by
                working
                together with the Internet Protocol. Transmission Control Protocol is designed as a backbone for
                connection, and
                it exhibits multiple key features.
            </p>
            <p>
                Features of Transmission Control Protocol:
            <ul>
                <li>Corresponds to the Transport Layer of OSI Model.</li>
                <li>Made to be reliable and connection oriented.</li>
                <li>Bytes that are not acknowledged will be retransmitted, with in specified time period.</li>

            <h2>
                FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL
            </h2>
            <p>
                FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol and FTP is an acronym for File Transfer Protocol. The transport
                protocol,
                that copies files, from one host, to another, is the File Transfer Protocol. File Transfer Protocol is a
                communication protocol, that is standard and used for transfer of computer files. In the File Transfer
                Protocol,
                both ends, the clients end and the servers end, can act as two processes called the Control Process and
                Data
                Transfer Process. Connections for data transfer and for control information are established with File
                Transfer
                Protocol, and it uses port 20 for the data connection and port 21 for the control connection.
            </p>
            <h2>
                TRIVIAL FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL
            </h2>
            <p>
                TFTP is the acronym for Trivial File Transfer Protocol. Trivial File Transfer Protocol is another
                communication
                protocol, that is used to transfer without authentication. Trivial File Transfer Protocol lacks in
                security
                features, because it does not use authentication and it does not keep the control and data information
                apart,
                hence Trivial File Transfer Protocol is not recommended. Trivial File Transfer Protocol makes UDP for
                data
                transport and separate datagram carry Trivial File Transfer Protocol messages. When a client requests a
                file to
                upload or download, then the Trivial File Transfer Protocol session will be initiated and then UDP port
                69 of
                the Trivial File Transfer Protocol server picks-up the request of the client, from the ephemeral UDP
                port.

                TELNET
            </h2>
            <p>
                The protocol called Telnet is used, by people to log in to remote computer, on the internet. “Telnet is
                an
                application protocol used on the Internet or local area network to provide a bidirectional interactive
                text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection.” (Telnet, 2021)
            </p>
            <h2>
                HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL
            </h2>
            <p>
                HTTP is the acronym for HyperText Transfer Protocol, and it is a communication protocol. The mechanism
                for
                communication is defined, by the HyperText Transfer Protocol, between the browser and the web server.
                Between
                the browser and the web server, the communication take place in request and response pairs, hence it is
                called
                the request and response protocol.
