                WEB APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE
            </h1>
            <p>
                Web applications are, like your typical computer application, but the difference with the web
                applications is
                that it is on the internet. Most developers are use opportune offerings, to attract as many users as
                possible,
                so they can benefit. Developers can benefit widely, from their projects, if they choose the type of web
                application architecture and the web apps components model, for your project, to succeed. These choices
                are very
                important, so your web app comes out unique and attractive. The web application architecture describes
                the
                interactions between applications, databases, and middleware systems on the web.” (Swapnil Banga, 2020)
                Web
                application architecture makes sure, that more than one application works simultaneously. A web app
                works
                similarly, to the request and response protocol, between the browser and the web server, when their code
                is
                parsed by the web browser. Web application architecture is indispensable, in todays day and age, because
                the
                most important parts of the global network traffic and apps and devices, all use web-based
                communication.
                Security, scalability, reliability, and robustness are all the features, that a web application
                architecture
                should deal with and also add efficiency, for good measure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two different codes run side-by-side, sub-programs, in a typical web application, and they are called
                client-side code and server-side code. The client-side code responds to some of the users input and it
                is
                allocated, in the browser. The server-side code responds to the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
                request and
                it is allocated, the server. The codes will do what the web developer sets them, to do, in the web
                applications.
                The server will do with respect to the browser code. C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, etc is
                used, for
                writing server-side code. Code that has the ability, to run on a server, it is code that can respond to
                HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Storing all types of data, page creation, user profiles, and user
                input is
                the server-side code. The end-user is unable to see all that.
            </p>
            <p>
                For writing the client-side code, we will need the combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and the web
                browser
                will parse the code. Client-side code can be modified, by the user, because the code is in human
                language, that
                human can understand making it readable, by humans. HTTP requests are the only way client-side code
                communicate
                and are not capable of reading any files, of the server directly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Web Application Components:
            <ul>
                <li>UI/UX Web Application Components</li>
                <li>Structural Components</li>
                <li>Client Components</li>
                <li>Server Component</li>
            </ul>
            Any two of the above can be considered web application components.
            </p>
            <h2>
                TYPES OF WEB APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE
            </h2>
            <p>
                “A web application architecture is a pattern of interaction between various web application components.”
                (Swapnil Banga, 2020) The logic, of the application, is distributed among the client and server side,
                which will
                be determined, by the type of web application architecture and there are three primary types.
            </p>
            <p>
                Types of Web Application Architecture:
            <ul>
                <li>Single-Page Applications (SPA)</li>
                <li>Microservices</li>
                <li>Serverless Architectures</li>
            </ul>
            The web application architecture is continuously evolving. The model and the type of web application
            architecture
            will determine, the security, responsiveness, etc. of a web application. Take time to explore the goals and
            possibilities, at that point, in time, before you start.
