            <h1>
                OVERVIEW OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB
            </h1>
            <p>
                WWW is the acronym for World Wide Web. “A technical definition of the World Wide Web is: all the
                resources and
                users on the Internet that are using the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).” (tutorials, 2021) Two
                people
                founded the World Wide Web, which Robert Cailliau and Tim Berners-Lee is one of the people, who helped
                find the
                World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The World Wide Web is basically a library, of all human knowledge,
                which is
                accessible through the internet, using the World Wide Web, which in hand, it is used for exchanging
                information
                between computers, on the internet. The web is the library, and the internet is the transport system.
            </p>
            <h2>
                EVOLUTION
            </h2>
            <p>
                The creators of the World Wide Web invented it, in 1989 at Cern, in Geneva.
            </p>
            <h2>
                WWW ARCHITECTURE
            </h2>
            <p>
                The World Wide Web is divided into several layers as listed below:
            <ul>
                <li>User Interface and Application</li>
                <li>Cryptography</li>
                <li>Character Set: UNICODE</li>
                <li>Identifiers: URI</li>
                <li>Trust</li>
                <li>Proof</li>
                <li>Ontologies: OWL</li>
                <li>Rules: RIF/SWRL</li>
                <li>Taxonomies: RDFS</li>
                <li>Querying: SPARGL</li>
                <li>Data Interchange: RDF</li>
                <li>Syntax: XML</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>
                IDENTIFIERS AND CHARACTER SET
            </h3>
            <p>
                URI stands for Uniform Resource Identifier, which helps identify the resources on the web and the the
                character
                set provides the UNICODE, that will in turn help make possible the building of the web pages, that
                humans will
                be able read, because it will have been written, in human languages.
            </p>
            <h3>
                SYNTAX
            </h3>
            <p>
                XML is the acronym for Extensible Markup Language. “In linguistics, syntax is the set of rules,
                principles, and
                processes that govern the structure of sentences in a given language, usually including word order. The
                term
                syntax is also used to refer to the study of such principles and processes.” (m, 2021) Syntax uses XML
                to help
                in defining the common syntax in semantic web, because the semantic web is directly read by computers
                and it is
                an extension, of the World Wide Web, and the semantic web’s goal is to make the internet data
                machine-readable.
            </p>
            <h3>
                DATA INTERCHANGE
            </h3>
            <p>
                The acronym for Resource Description Framework is RDF. “RDF is a specification that defines how
                metadata, or
                descriptive information, should be formatted.” (RDF, n.d.) The core representation of data will be
                defined, by
                the RDF, for the web and the resource data will be represented, in graph form.
            </p>
            <h3>
                TAXONOMIES
            </h3>
            <p>
                More standardized description will be allowed, by the RDFS, which is Resource Description Framework
                Schema, of
                taxonomies and other ontological constructs. “Ontology is the branch of philosophy that studies concepts
                such as
                existence, being, becoming, and reality. It includes the questions of how entities are grouped into
                basic
                categories and which of these entities exist on the most fundamental level.” (Ontology, 2021)
            </p>
            <h3>
                ONTOLOGIES
            </h3>
            <p>
                OWL stands for Web Ontology Language and it is better than Resource Description Framework Schema (RDFS),
                because
                3 more versions than RDFS. The three versions are OWL Lite, OWL DL, and OWL. Each of these versions have
                their
                advantages, like the OWL is for more syntactic freedom of Resource Description Framework (RDF), OWL Lite
                is for
                simple constraints and taxonomies, and OWL DL is for full description logic support.
            </p>
            <h3>
                RULES
            </h3>
            <p>
                RIF stands for Rule Interchange Format and it is part of the semantic web infrastructure. SWRL stands
                for
                Semantic Web Rule Language, and rules and logic are expressed through this proposed language for the
                semantic
                web. The acronym for Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language is SPARQL. SPARQL is a SQL language that
                helps with
                querying RDF data and OWL Ontologies.
            </p>
            <h3>
                PROOF
            </h3>
            <p>
                “All semantic and rules that are executed at layers below Proof and their result will be used to prove
                deductions.” (tutorials, 2021)
            </p>
            <h3>
                CRYPTOGRAPHY
            </h3>
            <p>
                Cryptography is the protection of information using codes and provides protection of communication,
                between two
                or more people. There are three types of cryptography and they are secret-key, public-key, and hash
                function.
                The origin of sources uses verification for these types of digital signatures.
            </p>
            <h3>
                USER INTERFACE AND APPLICATIONS
            </h3>
            <p>
                The User Interface and Application layer is used to interact with the user, the human and its designed
                goal is
                to make the interaction easier, for the user to use.
            </p>
            <h2>
                WWW OPERATION
            </h2>
            <p>
                WWW works on client-server approach.
            <ol>
                <li>The web browser gives the user the ability to insert the URL, of the webpage, in the address bar.
                </li>
                <li>The Domain Name Server of the webpage will be requested, by the browser for the IP address
                    corresponding to
                    the webpage.</li>
                <li>HTTP is used when the webpage to the web server is requested, by the browser, after receiving the IP
                    address. The web server and browser communicate through HTTP.</li>
                <li>The web server receives the request made by the browser using HTTP, and checks if that webpage does
                    exist,
                    if it does exist, the web server sends the results bac using the HTTP protocol connection and soon
                    after its
                    done, it closes the HTTP connection.</li>
                <li>When the web browser receives the webpage, from the web server, then it displays the content, for
                    the users
                    use, on the screen, in the web browser, after interpreting it.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <h2>
                ARCHITECTURE
            </h2>
            <p>
                More better protocols are required to be developed, because the huge growth of web is overloading and
                degrading
                the performance of the WWW.
