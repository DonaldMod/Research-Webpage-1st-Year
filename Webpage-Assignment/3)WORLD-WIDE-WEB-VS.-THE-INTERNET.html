                WORLD WIDE WEB VS. THE INTERNET
            </h1>
            <p>
                The World Wide Web is just an older name for internet, but both the World Wide Web and the internet
                describe
                different concepts and understanding the difference may lead to knowing how these online resources work.
                So, do
                people still use the Internet and the World Wide Web term interchangeably, well its about the semantics,
                of the
                words, they are so closely related, it is difficult, to tell them apart, if you don’t know the
                difference.

                “The World Wide Web is a network of web pages found by their addresses.” (World Wide Web vs. Internet:
                What's
                the Difference?, n.d.) It was developed at the European physics lab CERN. Tim Berners-Lee is the person,
                who
                proposed the World Wide Web and was tasked with creating, in 1989, and he came with results, that were
                part of
                the public domain, by the time he was done, in 1993. The World Wide Web include the HTTP data transfer
                protocol,
                HTML, and URL. URL stand for Uniform Resource Location and it is for every web page. HTML stands for
                HyperText
                Markup Language, it is the language of the Web, and by then it was the most popular web publishing
                format. HTTP
                stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol which is a system that standardized the use of HTML, basically
                the
                grammar rules, to use HTML.

            <h2>
                INTERNET

            <p>
                “The internet is the network of networks that provides the basis for the web.” (World Wide Web vs.
                Internet:
                What's the Difference?, n.d.) All types of digital data transfer was called ARPANET before and it is a
                mainframe
                computer. We use the Internet to access the web, and the accessibility of the web made everyone an
                internet
                user. The internet facilitates the World Wide Web, but the internet is a connection between a lot of
                devices in
                and around the world. When people send e-mails, you are sending information through the Internet.
