                HISTORY OF THE INTERNET (INCLUDING IMPORTANT DATES)
            </h1>
            <p>
                The internet was created in the 1960s to provide a way, for government researchers to communicate, much
                easier
                and exchange information. Computer back then were big and heavy, you could not take then anywhere, hence
                researchers had to go on the site of the computer or using magnetic computer tapes, which still would
                use the
                same postal system, that was being avoided, for sharing information, on a government level.
            </p>
            <p>
                Researcher’s sharing or exchanging information was not the only reason, the internet was invented,
                because when
                the internet was created, it was made for information to still be to be disseminated, even after a
                nuclear
                attack, because by this time The Soviet Union had launched the Sputnik satellite on October 4, 1957.
                This event
                made the researchers in America, shake in their boots, hence the ARPANET was created, which in today’s
                terms is
                called the internet. ARPNET stands for Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, and Vint Cerf created
                ARPANET
                on October 29, 1969. Access to ARPANET was only granted, to certain academic and research organisations
                that had
                bidding or collaborating contracts with the Defense Department, but in so doing so prompted others to
                make their
                own networks, to provide information sharing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ARPANET network was established in 1970, between Harvard, MIT, and BBN. In 1971, Project Gutenberg
                was
                underway, to make books and documents, in the public domain available electronically, for free. In 1972,
                France
                made their own project Cyclades, but it was shut down, but it did not go out, without adding some more
                knowledge
                or pioneer a key idea, on the network matter, that the network should not be responsible, for data
                transmission,
                but the host computer should. In 1974, the proposal for an inter-network, where there would be no
                central
                control and would work around a transmission control protocol. In 1975, John Vittal was a programmer,
                who
                programmed the “Reply” and “Forward” fumctionality, since e-mailing was a growing trend, that started in
                1971,
                by Ray Tomlinson, who also made the decision, to separate the user name from the computer, which ended
                up being
                the domain name, with the “@“ symbol. In 1977, the invention of the PC Modem came about, with its
                creators being
                Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington. In 1978, the first Bulletin Board System (BBS) was developed, and
                spam was
                born, when an unsolicited commercial email message was sent to e-mail users. In 1979, an internet-based
                discussion system was created, by two graduate students, to make it possible, for people to speak about
                the same
                topics, in around the globe. In 1980, ENQUIRE was launched, by CERN, written by Tim Berners-Lee. ENQUIRE
                was
                designed to keep track of people, projects using hypertext, and software, and this was made possible by
                using a
                hypertext program. In 1982, the first emoticon was credited to Scott Fahlman.

                The internet’s official birthday is said, to be on January 1, 1983. All these networks seemed, to be
                facing a
                similar problem, they were not able to communicate with each other, therefore causing a problem for
                information
                sharing, then a new communications protocol was established called TCP/IP. TCP/IP stands for Transfer
                Control
                Protocol/Internetwork Protocol. TCP/IP made communication among computers, on different networks,
                possible.
                ARPANET and the Defense Data Network officially changed to the TCP/IP standard on January 1, 1983, hence
                the
                birth of the Internet. All networks could now be connected by a universal language. (Board of Regents of
                the
                University System of Georgia, n.d.)

            <p>
                In 1984, the Domain Name System was created along with the Domain Name Server. The Domain Name Server
                converted
                the domain name, that an Internet user typed, to an IP address automatically, then typing all the
                numerical
                values, of an IP address and that is why the domain name system was created, to make it more
                human-friendly. In
                1985, The WELL was created, which stood for “Whole Earth ‘Lectronic Link’” and it is one of the oldest
                virtual
                communities. In 1987, the Internet grow, to an amount of 30,000 host, then the standard 1,000 hosts, the
                ARPANET
                offered, before the TCP/IP made it capacity much more larger. In 1988, IRC which stood for Internet
                Relay Chat
                was made, and had played a big part, to the instant messaging programs, that we now have, and this same
                year
                made way for the first major malicious intertent-based attacked, that cause major interruptions, in the
                major
                parts of the internet, which was created by Morris Tappen Morris, then in turn, was named after him,
                ”The Morris
                Worm.” In 1989, AOL which stood for America Online, made the internet popular, and it is still present
                ‘til this
                day, and the proposal, of the Work Wide Web, written by Tim Berners-Lee. In 1990, the first dial-up
                Internet
                Service Provider (ISP), called “The World” was made, and The World Web was finally finished. In 1991,
                the first
                of a lot, happen with the World Wide Web being completed, like the first web page was created, the first
                content-based search protocol called Gopher, and the first webcam. In 1993, Mosaic was the first
                graphical web
                browser for the general public, which was released in this year and it made the Internet easily
                accessible, to
                the general public, and also this year was taken advantage of by the government and made domain names,
                like .gov
                and.org for first time. In 2004, the Web 2.0 was created so software application will have the capacity,
                to use
                the full internet connectivity.
