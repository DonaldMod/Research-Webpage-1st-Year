            <h1>
                CLIENT-SIDE AND SERVER-SIDE ENGINEERING
            </h1>
            <p>
                “Server-side is the system that runs on the server, and client-side is the software that runs on a
                user’s web
                browser.” (Weinstein, 2020) All the data that is displayed on and seen in the web browser, by the user
                is the
                client-side web development, but all the work and code, that is done in the web and not seen, by the
                user is the
                server-side web. Since, web development is an umbrella term, that entails of multiple server field of
                website
                creation, which results in all the skilled developers, to come together and work on the project, to
                determine
                the products full functionality.

            <h2>
                CLIENT-SIDE WEB DEVELOPMENT
            </h2>
            <p>
                Visually appealing, functional, and dynamic websites are created using the coding skills the web
                developer has
                acquired, for client-side developing. The software that are supposed, to run on the client-side web are
                the
                homepages, shopping pages, and anything that requires the users input and the developers are commonly
                referred,
                to as ‘front end’ programmers, because the web page would usually, be in the front page and the user
                interaction
                would come from the usually. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the mostly over used scripting languages, for
                coding
                the client-side web development feature and data.
            </p>

            </h2>
            <p>
                The collection of information, that can be reached, by request from the client-side web browser. The
                webpage and
                the web servers are always in constant communication, when they are connected to the internet, for the
                data, to
                be requested and shared, from and to the web servers, better said, it is an exchange of data. This
                exchange of
                data is made possible, by the design, build, and maintenance of the server-side code made, by the
                software
                developer, themselves. Behind the scenes is where everything is run, as it should, on application
                servers. The
                programmers typically should be able to master the languages, Python, SQL, Ruby on Rails, PHP, and Java,
                because
                they are usually the languages used to code the Server-Side Web.
